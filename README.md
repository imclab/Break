One of my first experiments with code. A simple 2D particle system with physics and Kinect interaction.  
Done with [Processing](http://www.processing.org "See more of Processing ->"), with the following libraries: [SimpleOpenNI](https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/ "See more of SimpleOpenNI ->"), [Geomerative](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/ "See more of Geomerative ->") and [jBox2D](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing "See more of jBox2D ->").  

This program was possible thanks to [Daniel Shiffman's](http://www.shiffman.net "See more of Daniel Shiffman ->") [*Nature of Code*](http://natureofcode.com "See more of "Nature of Code" ->") book.
